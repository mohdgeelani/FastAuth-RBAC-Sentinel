**FastAuth-RBAC-Sentinel** is a production-grade authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) system built with **FastAPI**, **OAuth2**, and **JWT**, fully containerized with **Docker** Compose,  ‚Äî designed for scalability, security, and real-time observability.

Designed with enterprise-grade architecture in mind, this system goes beyond standard authentication by integrating real-time observability using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, and validating performance under stress through **Locust**-based load testing. 
During high-concurrency simulations, **the system sustained over 22,000+ requests**, **handled peak traffic of 70+ requests/sec, maintained low-latency response times with a 50th percentile at 15ms and a 95th at 340ms, and kept the error rate under 0.4%** ‚Äî all visualized through live Grafana dashboards.

FastAuth-RBAC-Sentinel is more than just an backend system ‚Äî it‚Äôs a secure, observable, and performance-tested system engineered for reliability and scale.

## üß† System Architecture

The diagram below outlines the complete internal workings of **FastAuth-RBAC-Sentinel**, from secure user registration and JWT-based authentication to real-time observability with Prometheus and Grafana.

- üîê **Authentication Flow**: Users register/login securely with credentials; JWT tokens are issued and verified for access to protected endpoints.
- üì¶ **Database Layer**: User data is securely stored in PostgreSQL with hashed credentials.
- üß† **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin and User roles enforce access restrictions at endpoint level.
- üìä **Observability Pipeline**: FastAPI exposes metrics via a Prometheus-compatible endpoint; Prometheus scrapes and Grafana visualizes the live metrics.
- üê≥ **Containerized Setup**: Every component is orchestrated using Docker Compose for local development and testing.

This modular, production-grade backend is designed to mimic real-world systems ‚Äî ensuring **robustness, observability, and scalability**.

## üîÅ How It Works

**FastAuth-RBAC-Sentinel** is built to mirror production backend systems, combining secure user management with powerful observability.

1. **User Registration & Login**  
   - Users (Admin or Normal) register via `/register` providing `username`, `email`, `password`, and `role`.
   - Authenticated using **OAuth2 Password Flow** with **JWT tokens**.
   - Upon successful login, a **JWT access token** is issued to access protected routes.

2. **Role-Based Access Control**  
   - Each route is protected using dependency injections to validate JWT and extract roles.
   - Admin-only routes (like `/admin-only`) are restricted and throw **401/403** errors if access is unauthorized.

3. **Prometheus Metrics Integration**  
   - All endpoints expose metrics via `/metrics`, collected using Prometheus.
   - Tracked metrics include:
     - Total Requests
     - Requests per Second
     - Latency (P50, P95)
     - Error Rate
     - Per-endpoint traffic volume

4. **Grafana for Real-Time Monitoring**  
   - A detailed Grafana dashboard presents a **live overview of system health**:
     - Traffic spikes, latency bottlenecks, and failure trends are visualized clearly.
     - Useful during both development and production simulation.

5. **Load Testing with Locust**  
   - Simulates realistic traffic with multiple users hitting routes like `/login`, `/users/me`, and `/admin-only`.
   - Performance results used to benchmark latency and stability under heavy load (e.g., 50 users for 5 minutes).


> This system is **modular, testable, monitorable**, and scalable ‚Äî meeting the key backend engineering pillars.

## üåü Final Thoughts

This project began as a simple authentication and RBAC system ‚Äî but with the ambition to build like real backend engineers do, it evolved into something far more meaningful.
From writing secure APIs to implementing protected routes, running load tests, capturing Prometheus metrics, and building live Grafana dashboards ‚Äî every component was built, debugged, tested, and tuned by hand.

This isn't just a codebase; it's a backend engineer‚Äôs journey of learning through building, breaking, and benchmarking ‚Äî with every metric earned.

```
                            ‚ö° Designed. Tested. Observed. Delivered.
                          üéØ Real traffic. Real metrics. Real experience.  
```
    FastAuth-RBAC-Sentinel is not just a personal project ‚Äî it's a simulation of production-grade engineering.
